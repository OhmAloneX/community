# Aqua Stars -- Open Source Contributors recognition program ðŸŒŸ
Aqua Stars is our continued commitment to recognize and reward top contributors to our open source projects. 

## How it works

Every month, the core contributors to Trivy and Tracee choose one contributor to become the Aqua Star of the month.

The person who has been chosen will be notified and will receive a swag package as a little `thank you` for their contributions.

### How can you become an Aqua Star ðŸŒŸ

There is no application process or specific requirements. You do not need to reach out to us to qualify to become an Aqua Star. 

Things we like to see:
* consistent contributions over a longer time period,
* providing community support by answering questions on the Aqua Open Source Slack as well as GitHub Discussions .

Both code and no-code contributions are counted.
